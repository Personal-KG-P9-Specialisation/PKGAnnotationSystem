		<h1>Guide to Annotation System</h1>
		<p>To understand the system, we have created this guide you can follow. When entering the system you are displayed a sentence with a highlighted entity mention as seen below.</p>
		<p><img src="https://github.com/Personal-KG-P9-Specialisation/PKGAnnotationSystem/blob/guide/conceptnet_linking/screen1.png?raw=true" alt="The screen you are displayed when entering the system" width="700" height="662" /></p>
		<p>Then you are prompted to select the correctly linked entity between a set of entities and two special options, namely 'Entity not in options' and 'Need more context'.&nbsp;<em>Entity not in options&nbsp;</em>refer to there not being the correct linked entity to pick from.&nbsp;<em>Need more context&nbsp;</em>means that from the given utterance it is not possible to deem which entity is the correct.</p>
		<p>To select the desired option, one can either click the correct option or use the numbers highlighted in red below.</p>
		<p><img src="https://github.com/Personal-KG-P9-Specialisation/PKGAnnotationSystem/blob/guide/conceptnet_linking/screen2.png?raw=true" alt="The screen you are displayed when entering the system" width="700" height="662" /></p>
		<p>For this example with the entity mention 'track', the first assumption would probably be to link it to the first entity 'track'. To understand whether this refer to the same concept, we can click the question mark (?) on the right as below.</p>
		<p><img src="https://github.com/Personal-KG-P9-Specialisation/PKGAnnotationSystem/blob/guide/conceptnet_linking/screen3.png?raw=true" alt="Selecting the question mark option on the entity suggestion" width="700" height="333" /></p>
		<p>This will then redirect us to the page you see below, which gives related information to the entity in question. Then we will have to deem whether the entity mention refer to the related information as well. If it does then we can select the entity as the correct match for the entity mention.</p>
